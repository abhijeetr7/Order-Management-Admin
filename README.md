# Order-Management-Admin

This HTML document provides a fully functional Order Management Admin Panel. It includes a responsive layout, dynamic table rendering, sorting by columns, filtering by order status, pagination, and a modal for viewing and editing order details. You can also export the filtered and sorted data to a CSV file.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: Uses Tailwind CSS for a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Dynamic Table: Orders are rendered dynamically from JavaScript data.

Filtering: Filter orders by their status (All, Pending, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled).

Sorting: Click on table headers (Order ID, Customer, Date, Total, Status) to sort the data in ascending or descending order.

Pagination: Navigate through pages of orders with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

View/Edit Modal: Click "View" to see order details in a read-only modal, or "Edit" to modify customer, date, total, status, and items.

CSV Export: Export the currently displayed (filtered and sorted) order data into a CSV file.

Feel free to modify the dummy data or extend the features as needed!
